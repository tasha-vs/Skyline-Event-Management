This is an event management system i created for an assignment in my 'Web Application Development' paper i completed at WelTec.
This app was developed in Visual Studio using ASP.NET MVC.
This app contains a MySQL database. 
NOTE: If you recieve a roslyn error when trying to run the solution within visual studio, open the package manager console and enter: 'Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r'
Since this app contains a database, please ensure it is correctly attached before trying to run this application. Some of the views have been created using scaffolding.
